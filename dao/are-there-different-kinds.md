DAOs have grown exponentially in number as well as types in the past couple of years and continue to do so.

There are a myriad DAOs that can be divided into different categories based on how they are organised as well as what the goal of the DAO is.

Some of the categories common today include:

* Protocol DAOs
* Investment DAOs
* Service DAOs
* Social DAOs
* Collector DAOs
* Media DAOs

This list by [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) encompasses all kinds of DAOs out there.
