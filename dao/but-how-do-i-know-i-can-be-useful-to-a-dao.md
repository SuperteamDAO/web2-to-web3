So you've joined a DAO but now you have no idea how to get involved.

Joining an existing community can be a little overwhelming for a newbie coming in because the members often have relationships formed amongst them by collaborating on projects in the past.

The way to go here is to find projects the DAO is working on and reach out to the people working on it to see if they need anything done.

A DAO may also have a list of tasks to be done in their database for people to pick up which might be a good place for you to start and create your merit in the group.
