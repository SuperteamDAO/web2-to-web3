# ⌛ How did they even come about?

Vitalik Buterin was the first to mention Decentralised Autonomous Organisations in the introductory paragraph of the Ethereum Whitepaper. He also wrote a blog on these corporations back in 2013.

Since then, the first organisation to really work on these lines was The DAO which launched in April 2016 as a decentralized venture capital fund. Its members contributed ETH and received DAO tokens in return that could be used for voting on which projects the funds should be allocated to.

It raised $150 million in ETH and was hacked with $60 million stolen. This hack led to a lot of people becoming sceptic for the term DAO for some years to come but they've eventually come around and pose to change the way organisations structure themselves in the future.
