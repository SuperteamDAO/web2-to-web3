If the goal of the DAO you propose to build is set in stone and has a product-market fit, you're definitely gmi. The interesting part here, like any new venture, is that there is no fixed playbook to starting a DAO.

**The best way to learn is by actually starting one.**

However, there are a lot of different tools that can help someone looking to build a DAO to form the infrastructure and its organisation. This blog by Nichanan Kesonpat is the perfect place to start if it's the tools that you're looking for.

The most important part of building a DAO, however, still remains the community. The people who will form the working group, as well as the consumers/audience/supporters are the ones who will determine the success rate of a DAO. This [blog](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/how-to-grow-decentralized-communities-1bf1044924f8) by Peter Pan is a good place to start thinking about building decentralised communities.
