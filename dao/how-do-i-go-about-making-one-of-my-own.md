If the goal of the DAO you propose to build is set in stone and has a product-market fit, you're definitely gmi. The interesting part here, like any new venture, is that there is no fixed playbook to starting a DAO.

**The best way to learn is by actually starting one.**

The most important part of building a DAO, however, still remains the community. The people who will form the working group, as well as the consumers/audience/supporters are the ones who will determine the success rate of a DAO.
