*DAOs pose to change the way organisations, as well as individuals, work in the future.*

The concept of an organisation formed by a bunch of individuals around a common goal seems simple but could essentially bridge the gap between the standard employee and the freelancer by giving a person a proportionate say in decision making but also providing the freedom to be a free agent and not bound within a job.

This means that the days when an employee is just a cog in the industrial machinery could be a thing of the past, and people will be able to contribute meaningfully as per their own skill sets and also have a say in the organisation.

In a world in which capital and labour are abundant, DAOs will end up filtering out talent and allow for work that is focused on creation and innovation instead of the stand corporation focused on shareholder wealth.
