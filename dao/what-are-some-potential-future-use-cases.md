Like with everything in web3, the potential use cases in the future are abundant. DAOs have a ton of use cases and we're only at the start of the space.

From a creator starting his DAO for his "1000 true fans" to a hedge fund DAO, a lot of different models are being explored in the space as we move into the proposed DAO Summer of 2022.

Some interesting ideas being explored are:

- Creator DAOs
- Tokenised Communities
- Investor DAOs
- Curator DAOs
- Hedge Fund DAOs
