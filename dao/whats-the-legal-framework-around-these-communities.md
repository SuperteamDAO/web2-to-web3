Legal frameworks around DAOs are still in their infancy stage and the laws that apply differ from one place to another.

However, legal frameworks are extremely important to consider especially if you're considering building one. The article provided below points out two concepts for this.

- Legal Liability
- Tax Protection

>"The first is obvious - if you are setting up a DAO, neither you nor the actual members of the DAO should be putting themselves in any legal jeopardy. The second is more nuanced - your DAO should pay taxes somewhere. If you don’t, your local jurisdiction may come after the DAO itself."

One interesting development in this regard that has taken place recently is the Wyoming DAO Law becoming the first to address these Decentralised Organisations. It would be of no surprise if more cities follow suit soon and the laws around DAOs could be much more streamlined.
