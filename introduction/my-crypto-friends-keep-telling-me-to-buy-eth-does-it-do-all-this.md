So we've already discussed how a blockchain is an open-source ledger that stores data in an encrypted and decentralized manner. We've also gone over some of the use cases of a blockchain, including smart contracts.

**This is where Ethereum comes in.**

Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain that allows developers to easily create and run smart contracts. Creating smart contracts requires the use of Solidity, which is Ethereum's native programming language.

In other words, you can think of Ethereum as a large decentralized supercomputer that provides the infrastructure on top of which all kinds of decentralized apps can run. So everything we've discussed before, including DAOs, NFTs and DeFi, can be coded to run on the Ethereum blockchain.

Its general-purpose nature has seen it become the preferred blockchain for most web3 developers. Indeed, its token ETH has the second-largest market capitalisation after Bitcoin.
