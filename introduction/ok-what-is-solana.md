Solana, like Ethereum, is a layer-1 blockchain (L1). An L1 provides the infrastructure or pipelines on which all kinds of dApps, Smart Contracts and decentralized exchanges can be deployed.

But what differentiates Solana from other L1s, especially Ethereum? The answer is speed, cost and resultantly efficiency. As we’ve discussed all blockchains must use some kind of consensus mechanism to validate transactions that occur on-chain. Bitcoin and Ethereum (for now) use a proof of work consensus mechanism, which requires validators to contribute computing power to solve complex mathematical problems or hashes.

Solana, on the other hand, uses a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (explained in detail in the video below). Proof of History allows Solana to create blocks much faster than PoW, which in turn increases speed (nearly 50k transactions per second) and reduces fees for transactions.

Fast speeds and low transaction costs have led to Solana’s emergence as a preferred L1 solution for all kinds of DeFi, NFT and fantasy sports platforms. Its popularity can be gauged by the fact that Solana is now the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
