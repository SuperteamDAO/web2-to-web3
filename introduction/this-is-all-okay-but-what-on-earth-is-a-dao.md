# ðŸ¤” This is all okay, but what on earth is a DAO?

In the world of web3, they say if 2021 was the year of NFTs, 2022 will be the year of DAOs. So better be prepared for it and start with what a DAO even is.

**A DAO is often described as sort of a â€œReddit community with a bank account.**

>It's **Autonomous in nature**, meaning it has its own set of pre-decided rules and is usually backed by a smart contract and a treasury to function.GreenRedBlue

>It's an **Organisation**, just like conventional organisations and companies, people come together with different expertise and work towards a common objective.
