*Yes, you most certainly can.*

Solana NFTs played a huge part in the DeFi Summer of 2021 that went by as the space exploded with projects like the Degen Ape Academy and Aurory going to the moon.

Solana offers a lot to the degen NFT Collector due to its high-speed transactions and **NO GAS FEES**. Hence, a lot of different projects have come up recently and you can check them out on marketplaces like [Solsea](https://solsea.io/) and [Solanart](https://solanart.io/).
