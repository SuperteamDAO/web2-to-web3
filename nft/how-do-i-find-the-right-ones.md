Finding the right NFTs can mean different things for different people. There are a bunch of marketplaces like [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) on Ethereum and [Solsea](https://solsea.io/) and [Solanart](https://solanart.io/) on Solana for you to discover and buy different projects.

But with so many new projects, the hard question is how to decipher between projects with legs and potential rug pulls.

While we always suggest DYOR (Do your own research) and this is obviously NFA (Not financial advice), there are some parameters that can be a good indicator of how a project would do.

### The Team

The jockey is often more important than the horse in the race. While art is subjective, a good team with a history of successful projects and proof-of-work is a good sign for the project's future and the community they will be able to gather.

### Roadmap

Just vibes are fun, but a solid roadmap wins most of the time. Research about what the project is looking to do in the future always pays off as it is a good sign of its longevity. In a constantly evolving space, a solid plan about future drops, utility, etc. will pay off in the end. 

### Utility

NFTs are abundant. Just a PFP might not be able to cut it in this ever-growing space. That is why a lot of new projects are coming up with different utilities attached to their NFT projects. Utilities can range from getting a character in a game, or access to a token-gated community. Find what works for you and ape in.
