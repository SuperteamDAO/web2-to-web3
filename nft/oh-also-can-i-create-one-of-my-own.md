# ðŸŽ¨ Oh also, can I create one of my own?

**Yes, you can!**

Anyone can create an NFT of their own. You could have an NFT for your photographs, videos, audio clips and even blogs and books.

It gets more interesting, you could even have an NFT collection of your own, people could buy it from you.

We need to go to [opensea.io](https://opensea.io/) and enter all the details like content file (image or audio), name of your NFT, supply (number of NFTs), metadata (details of NFT), blockchain (Solana, Ethereum, polygon) and that's it. Now you can mint your own NFT.

It's that simple!
