# ðŸ“‰ What if I get rekt?

As bullish we are on NFTs as a concept, the reality of the matter is that most of the projects out there are going to fail in the future.

As more and more influencers, companies, celebrities and artists get exposed to this exciting new world, a lot of new projects are going to come up in the future which will end up raising the supply so high and leave the demand down below.

From a financial standpoint, the message here is to only invest the amount of money you are willing to lose completely. It is good to be bullish on the concept of digital art and the space, but the best way to not get rekt in the process is to not bet your house on anything.

Buy what you genuinely like, and only what you can afford. Staying away from FOMO and moonboys will save you from getting rekt.
