Addressing the elephant in the room here.

>Wikipedia defines it as "A collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet."

This is what the conventional definition has been for a long time now and it does serve its purpose but with NFTs and the blockchain coming in, we might have a revolution on our hands.

One might say that through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, we already live in the metaverse because most of our lives are spent digitally. That is true, kinda.

While we do have digital identities, blockchain and NFTs give them authentication as well as scarcity. The picture I have as my PFP might be used by someone else as well, but the NFT I own and digitally present myself with is truly owned by just me.

And this goes beyond just identities. Digital real estate can now be verifiably bought in games like Decentraland and you can customise your property, just like you would IRL.

This changes everything. The breadth and depth that the digital universe can go using the Blockchain are immense, and we are still early.
