>"NFTs are blockchain-based records that uniquely represent pieces of media. The media can be anything digital, including art, videos, music, gifs, games, text, memes, and code. NFTs contain highly trustworthy documentation of their history and origin, and can have code attached to do almost anything programmers dream up (one popular feature is code that ensures that the original creator receives royalties from secondary sales)." - Chris Dixon

We've mentioned these points before, but it's important to reiterate as these factors make the NFT ecosystem a goldmine of opportunities for Creators and Artists.

For the longest time, creators have struggled with rights over their intellectual property and institutions ripping them off because of their grip over the market. NFTs allow creators to own their pieces of art, buy and sell them as and when they want and also utilise them in any way they feel like. We're already seeing singers launching their albums as NFTs so users can buy them from them directly, creating an economy around their art pieces.

The possibilities for a creator here are endless. The ones who're coming on board will reap the rewards for it.
